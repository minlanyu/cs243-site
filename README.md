# CS 243, Fall 2020: Advanced Computer Networks

## Overview

This is a graduate-level course on computer networks. It provides a comprehensive overview on advanced topics in network protocols and networked systems. The course will cover both classic papers on computer networks and recent research results. It will examine a wide range of topics including routing, congestion control, network architectures, network management, datacenter networks, software-defined networking, and programmable networks, with an emphasis on core networking concepts and principles and their usage in practice. The course will include lectures, in-class presentations, paper discussions, and a research project.

## Textbook
-There are no required textbooks for the course. We have papers for your references in the syllabus page. You have to read the papers before each class to get the most out of the class. For backgrounds, you are encouraged to refer to the following books:
- For basic networking concepts, you can refer to the textbook (K&R): Computer Networking: A Top-Down Approach (7th edition), by Jim Kurose and Keith Ross. Earlier editions are fine. 
- An alternative book is Computer Networks: A Systems Approach (5th edition), by Larry Peterson and Bruce Davie. You can find [an online version](https://proquest-safaribooksonline-com.ezp-prod1.hul.harvard.edu/9780123850591) in Harvard library.
- Please contact me if some concepts are hard to understand and I'll provide more supplemental materials.

## Coursework

## Syllabus

## Diversity and Inclusion
I would like to create a learning environment in our class that supports a diversity of thoughts, perspectives and experiences, and honors your identities (including race, gender, class, sexuality, socioeconomic status, religion, ability, etc.). I (like many people) am still in the process of learning about diverse perspectives and identities. If something was said in class (by anyone) that made you feel uncomfortable, please talk to me about it. If you feel like your performance in the class is being impacted by your experiences outside of class, please donâ€™t hesitate to come and talk with me. As a participant in course discussions, you should also strive to honor the diversity of your classmates. (Statement extracted from one by Dr. Monica Linden at Brown University.)


## Accommodations for Disabilities
If you have a health condition that affects your learning or classroom experience, please let me know as soon as possible. I will, of course, provide all the accommodations listed in your AEO letter (if you have one), but sometimes we can do even better if a student helps me understand what really matters to them. (Statement adapted from one by Prof. Krzysztof Gajos.)
